# Experiments using score entropy discrete diffusion for protein design 

- This code is a fork of and wholly based on [Aaron Lou's implementation of score entropy discrete diffusion](https://github.com/louaaron/Score-Entropy-Discrete-Diffusion), which is fully described in his research paper (which was voted ICML 2024 Best Paper), "Discrete Diffusion Modeling by Estimating the Ratios of the Data Distribution" ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16834](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16834))
- The goal of this repository is to evaluate the usefulness of score entropy discrete diffusion for understanding protein sequences
- We hope to be able to use trained models to design new proteins with desired properties
