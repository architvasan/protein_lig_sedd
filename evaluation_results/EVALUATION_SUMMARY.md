# 🎯 SEDD Model Evaluation Summary

## 📊 **Quick Stats**
- **Model**: 66.7M parameters, trained for 1,000 steps
- **Samples**: 50 unique sequences generated (100% diversity)
- **Quality**: Mixed results - excellent diversity, poor distribution matching

## 🏆 **Key Metrics**
| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| KL Divergence | 3.43 | Poor (>2.0) |
| JS Divergence | 0.19 | Acceptable (0.1-0.3) |
| Sample Diversity | 1.00 | Excellent (>0.9) |
| Unique Samples | 50/50 | Perfect |

## 🎯 **Main Findings**

### ✅ **Strengths**
- Perfect sample diversity (no duplicates)
- Stable generation process
- Model architecture working correctly

### ⚠️ **Issues**
- Heavy bias toward token 1 (57.6% vs 30.6% in training)
- Underutilization of vocabulary
- Shorter sequences than training data (245 vs 512 tokens)

## 💡 **Recommendations**
1. **Continue Training**: Current 1,000 steps → 50,000+ steps
2. **Optimize Sampling**: Adjust temperature and diffusion steps
3. **Extended Evaluation**: Generate 500+ samples for better statistics
4. **Biological Validation**: Check sequence validity

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
The model shows promise but needs significantly more training to achieve high-quality generation that matches the training distribution.
